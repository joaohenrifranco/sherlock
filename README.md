# ESP8266 WifiSniffer

This is only an easy experiment which uses the ESP8266 wifi module to look for near smartphones around you. 

## Code  

This repository uses [Platformio](http://platformio.org/platformio-ide) to compile and upload code to ESP8266 but you can also use it with [Arduino IDE](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino#installing-with-boards-manager).

I use one [nodeMCU devkit](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-devkit) because is a fast and easy way to program the chip because it includes serial to usb converter and breadboard compatibility but there are [many flavors](http://www.esp8266.com/wiki/doku.php?id=esp8266-module-family) available.
